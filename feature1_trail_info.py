You are an expert naturalist and urban trail guide.

Generate the following information (4-6 sentences each) for the {trail_name} located in {location}:
1. Total length in miles and kilometers. Give a reasonable estimate for a trail of this name in San Jose.
2. Approximate times to complete the whole trail (one-way), from start to midpoint, and out-and-back (round trip), assuming moderate-walking pace and noting if trail is longer or shorter.
3. The overall level of difficulty for the trail on a scale of Easy/Moderate/Hard, with a brief justification.
4. 2 interesting facts about the trail or area, based on typical urban creekside trails in the region.
5. 2-3 common or important safety cautions or environmental hazards to watch for along this trail.
6. List 4‚Äì6 plausible stop names (landmarks, bridges, parks, or viewpoints) in order along the trail, which will be used for the virtual walk. List only names and very short descriptions.
7. Provide a brief (1-2 sentence) general description of a virtual route for this trail‚Äîdescribe the main landscape, possible wildlife, and scenery, and add a link to [San Jose Trail Maps](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/parks-recreation-neighborhood-services/planning-development/trail-network/trail-maps).
